Draw a sequence diagram for an online food delivery system that takes into account all the nuances and intricacies of the system. The diagram should include the following components and interactions:
1. User interaction with the application (registration, login, browsing, searching, filtering, and selecting a restaurant).
2. Displaying the restaurant's menu, allowing the user to select items and customize them (e.g., add toppings, special instructions, etc.).
3. Implementing a shopping cart for adding, updating, and removing items, as well as displaying the order summary.
4. Integrating a secure payment system for the user to enter their payment information and complete the transaction.
5. Confirming the order and sending notifications to the user, restaurant, and the delivery partner.
6. The restaurant's process of accepting the order, preparing the food, and packaging it for delivery.
7. The delivery partner's process of picking up the order from the restaurant, navigating to the user's location, and delivering the food.
8. The user receiving real-time updates on the order status, estimated delivery time, and tracking the delivery partner's location.
9. Enabling the user, restaurant, and delivery partner to communicate with each other in case of any issues or updates.
10. Upon delivery completion, allowing the user to rate and review the restaurant and the delivery experience.
The diagram should be clear, easy to follow, and should visually demonstrate the flow of information and actions between the various components of the system. Additionally, please ensure that the diagram maintains a consistent design and uses appropriate notations for sequence diagrams.
